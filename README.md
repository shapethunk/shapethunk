# 🌊 Hi, I’m [@shapethunk](https://github.com/shapethunk).
## 👔 This is my stylistically unoriginal profile README.
### 🎭 I'm also occasionally known as threadmetal, shapethink, or "Rob". 

👀 I’m interested in machine learning as applied to software development and maintenance.

🔰 I’m currently learning modern toolchains and applied psychology.

🔬 I’m looking to collaborate on any project that needs to find a bug.

💬 The best ways to reach me are here on GitHub and on gmail.

😄 Pronouns: he / him / daddy / "mo bingles peas"

🌱 Fun fact: I'm re-entering society after a long sabbatical which turned off spiritual caps-lock.

<hr>Thanks for your time. Send me something if you like, so I can say it's nice to meet you!
<br>👋🏻 ~rmk
